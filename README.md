# GitRepoMon
Git Hub Repositor Monitor Application


The program can be run as java application with Main class - GitHub_Repo_Monitor/src/main/java/com/servrock/GitRepoMonApplication.java

Once the springboot application starts up , one can make the following REST API calls using Postman tool or browser

1) To load the commit info in to the in-memory H2 DB, specify the owner (octocat) and the repo name (hello-world) as path variables

                  GET http://localhost:8080/loadcommits/octocat/hello-world
Sample Response
                  [

                          "commentEntList": [
                              {

                                  "id": 2982942,
                                  "user": "outao",
                                  "body": "lets start a new journey!!!\n"
